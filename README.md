# rapid-personal-sites

This repository represents the full site content.

## Code

This site is developed primarily in JQuery and Bootstrap for the front-end and Python/Django/Wagtail for the back-end.  It hosts simple websites meant to showcase someone's talent.  Ideally it would host them on yourname.com.  

## Rapid Development

This allows for rapid development of personal websites but scales to suit individuals of any skill level.  The ideal individual has some background in programming but it works for beginner, intermediate, and advanced skillsets.
